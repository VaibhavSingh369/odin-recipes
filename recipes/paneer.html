    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Paneer Tikka is a popular and delicious tandoori starter and snack where
      Paneer (Indian cottage cheese cubes) are marinated in a spiced
      yogurt-based marinade, arranged on skewers and grilled in the oven. Worry
      not if you don’t have an oven – instead of grilling in oven, you can make
      Tandoori Paneer Tikka Recipe on stovetop on a tawa/skillet. In this post I
      am sharing both the oven and stovetop methods.

    <h2>Ingradients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Paneer (Indian Cottage Cheese)</li>
      <li>Marinade</li>
      <li>Veggies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel, rinse and dice 1 medium-sized onion in square shaped 1 to 1.5
        inches pieces. Rinse and slice 1 small to medium sized capsicum (green
        bell pepper) in 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. You will need ½ cup each of
        onions and capsicum. Set these aside. You can also use tomatoes if you
        want.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next add 1 tablespoon mustard oil. If you do not have mustard oil, then
        use a neutral tasting oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly and gently mix them with the marinade. Cover and keep the
        marinated paneer and veggies in the refrigerator for 2 hours or more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove once done. Serve the paneer tikka sprinkled with some chaat
        masala and lemon juice. Also serve mint chutney, onion slices and lemon
        wedges as sides.
